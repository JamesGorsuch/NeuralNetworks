----First Neural Network is my first one, using random mutation and selecting the best traits got me so far with simple data
    I began to see that it was not very good at more complex tasks like the spiral data 
    The data being used is nnfs sample data, this makes it easy to see the network function

----I read through different ways to increase effiency instead of random mutation and found back propagation
    After a good while learning how it works and what mistakes I made attempting to implement it, it got it working
    I tested 10 or so points and had 90% accuracy
